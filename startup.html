  <h2>Where Code Meets Calm</h2>
  <p>I’m currently working on a startup called <strong>MadGlow</strong> — a project that brings together skincare, technology, 
     and creativity. It’s a mix of everything I love: problem-solving, design, and making ideas come to life.</p>

  <p>Our team has been developing an app that helps people track their skincare journey and learn what works best for them. 
     Along the way, I’ve been learning about both the <strong>technical side</strong> of app development and the <strong>marketing side</strong> of building a brand from scratch.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Working on app development and testing features</li>
    <li>Designing a clean, easy-to-use interface</li>
    <li>Creating marketing content and building a small online community</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It’s been a fun challenge — turning an idea into something real, one late-night brainstorming session at a time.</p>
