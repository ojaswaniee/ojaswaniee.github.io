  <h2>Books I Keep Close</h2>
  <p>Some stories linger long after the last page. Here are a few that did.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Legend</strong> – Marie Lu</dt>
    <dd>A sharp, fast-paced dystopian story where two brilliant teens—one a criminal, one a prodigy—collide in a divided future. I love how their worlds clash yet fit together perfectly and how the book explored so many powerful themes like romance, ambition and politics at the same time. it is mewsant for a young adult audience and has been amongst my favorites since i read it when I was 15</dd>
  
    <dt><strong>Lightlark</strong> – Alex Aster</dt>
    <dd>A fantasy world wrapped in secrets, curses, and impossible choices. It’s dramatic and lush, and every chapter feels like a plot twist waiting to happen. I really loved the fantasy and escapism aspect of this.</dd>
  
    <dt><strong>The Mortal Instruments</strong> – Cassandra Clare</dt>
    <dd>Angels, demons, shadowhunters, and chaos. This series basically raised an entire generation of fantasy kids, me included. It’s messy, magical, and addictive in the best way.</dd>
  
    <dt><strong>Delirium</strong> – Lauren Oliver</dt>
    <dd>A society where love is treated like a disease—until someone catches it. It’s haunting and beautiful, and I still think about its ending years later.</dd>
