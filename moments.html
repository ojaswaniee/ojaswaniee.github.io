  <h2>Moments & Verses</h2>
  <p>Oh this might get a little philosophical lol — call me an old soul, but I find peace in nature, night, moon, sunsets, breezes, books, poetry, the smell of rain, flowers, and people who feel like a hug.</p>

  <blockquote>“I write because it makes me feel like someone’s listening — or am I finally listening to myself?”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“A hopeful heart is a home for miracles.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“There’s no right time — just time, and what you do with it.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“There’s a saying in Tibet: if a problem can be solved, there’s no use worrying about it; if it can’t be solved, worrying will do no good.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“You are the series of mistakes that had to happen for you to find you.” — Atticus</blockquote>
